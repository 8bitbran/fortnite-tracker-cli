# FortniteTracker

FortniteTracker uses the HTTParty gem to make requests to the [Fortnite Tracker API](https://fortnitetracker.com/site-api) as well as Colorize, RMagick, and ASCIIart for creative touches. You get Fortnite players' stats with their platform and username, then select from a menu of options to view specific information. Each request instantiates a new Player object, unless the Player already exists.
