# ForniteTracker

FortniteTracker uses the httparty gem to make requests to the TRN Fortnite Tracker API as well as Colorize, RMagick, and ASCIIart for creative touches. You get Fortnite players' stats with their platform and username, then select from a menu of options to view specific information. Each request instantiates a new Player object, unless the Player already exists.
